# CarDekho Price Prediction

CarDekho launches a vehicle shopping mall in Jaipur, showcasing the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of the used car market in India. This project aims to address the challenge of accurately pricing used cars using a Machine Learning model trained on real-world data.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The used car market in India experiences significant price fluctuations based on various factors:
- Make and model of the car.
- Mileage and condition.
- Current market conditions.

Accurately pricing used cars can be challenging for sellers, leading to inefficiencies in the market. This project proposes a solution using machine learning to predict car prices effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on its features, helping sellers price their cars accurately and buyers find competitively priced vehicles.

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Load and explore the dataset for insights.
   - Check for missing values and perform data preprocessing.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Analyze and select features relevant to price prediction.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

3. **Model Development**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train and evaluate different Machine Learning models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate performance.
   - Fine-tune the best-performing model for improved accuracy.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the model for real-time price prediction.
